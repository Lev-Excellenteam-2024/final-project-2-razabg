    "slide number :1--The slide is about AsyncIO, which is a module in Python that allows for asynchronous programming. This means that instead of waiting for one task to finish before moving on to the next task, AsyncIO allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, making the program more efficient. AsyncIO is especially useful for programs that involve a lot of input/output operations, such as web scraping or network programming. It uses the \"await\" keyword to pause a task until a specific event occurs, allowing other tasks to continue running in the meantime. By using AsyncIO, developers can create faster and more responsive programs.",
    "slide number :2--In synchronous programs, code instructions are executed sequentially, one after the other, and each instruction starts only when the previous one has finished. In asynchronous programs, instructions can run concurrently, meaning their runtimes may overlap. This allows tasks to start and end during the execution of other instructions, giving more flexibility in the order in which tasks are completed.",
    "slide number :3--The text is asking how we can cook multiple components of a meal at the same time, instead of one after the other. For example, boiling noodles while also preparing the sauce and cutting vegetables. This can save time and make the whole cooking process faster overall.",
    "slide number :4--Concurrency refers to the ability to execute multiple tasks at the same time. Parallelism involves doing things simultaneously, like two people slicing veggies together or a multi-core CPU running multiple processes. Time slicing, on the other hand, involves interlacing tasks and taking turns, like slicing veggies, stirring noodles, then slicing more veggies. This is similar to an operating system kernel juggling between processes/threads on a single CPU core.",
    "slide number :5--The slide is talking about two types of tasks that a computer processor (CPU) can perform: CPU-bound and IO-bound.\n\nCPU-bound tasks require a lot of computation and the bottleneck is the speed at which the CPU can process the computations. Examples of CPU-bound tasks include image analysis, sorting arrays, and training neural networks.\n\nOn the other hand, IO-bound tasks involve waiting for certain actions to be completed before moving on. The bottleneck in this case is the idle waiting time. Examples of IO-bound tasks include reading a file, making an HTTP request, and saving data in a database.\n\nIn simpler terms, CPU-bound tasks are like slicing veggies where the focus is on the actual work being done, while IO-bound tasks are like waiting for noodles to boil where the focus is on waiting for something to finish.",
    "slide number :6--When a task is CPU-bound, it means that the task is using a lot of the central processing unit's resources. In this case, the optimization focuses on improving the performance of the task by utilizing the CPU more efficiently.\n\nOn the other hand, when a task is IO-bound, it means that the task is limited by input/output operations, such as reading/writing data from/to a disk or network. The optimization for IO-bound tasks focuses on improving the input/output operations to make the task faster.",
    "slide number :7--In this slide, it is explaining the concept of optimizing tasks based on whether they are CPU-bound or IO-bound.\n\n- For CPU-bound tasks (tasks that require a lot of processing power), you can optimize them by parallelization, which means having multiple people work on the task at the same time. Just like how two people slicing noodles can work faster together, but they still have to wait for the noodles to cook before moving on.\n\n- For IO-bound tasks (tasks that involve input/output operations, like reading from or writing to a storage device), you can optimize them by time-slicing, which means alternating between different tasks while waiting for one task to complete. In this example, you can slice more veggies while waiting for one to cook, but switching between different veggies might actually take more time in total.",
    "slide number :8--Concurrency is the ability of a computer system to handle multiple tasks at the same time. Parallelism involves splitting the work between multiple processes or threads to speed up the process. Multiprocessing splits the work between multiple processes, while threading splits the work between multiple threads. In Python, threading is not as effective because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python code simultaneously. Time-slicing is a method used in threading where different threads take turns executing. AsyncIO is a library in Python that allows for asynchronous programming.",
    "slide number :9--Threading and AsyncIO are two ways to handle multiple tasks at the same time in programming. Threading is pre-emptive, meaning the operating system decides when to switch between different tasks, which can sometimes cause problems like race-conditions. AsyncIO is cooperative, meaning the programmer decides when to switch between different tasks. AsyncIO is also single-threaded and can perform non-blocking operations using system calls.",
    "slide number :10--Concurrency involves executing multiple tasks at the same time, either sequentially or in parallel. This can be useful for both CPU-bound tasks, where the processor is the bottleneck, and IO-bound tasks, where input/output operations are the bottleneck. This can be achieved through techniques such as threading, multiprocessing, and AsyncIO in Python. Threading involves running multiple threads within a single process, while multiprocessing involves running multiple processes in parallel. AsyncIO is a library in Python that allows for asynchronous I/O operations.",
    "slide number :11--AsyncIO works by using an event-loop that manages tasks. Each task is a coroutine, which is an async function. The event-loop runs these tasks one by one until they are all completed. This allows for asynchronous behavior and efficient execution of tasks.",
    "slide number :12--AsyncIO allows coroutines to pause their tasks when awaiting for an IO operation. The coroutines save their current state and inform the event-loop when they are awaiting an IO operation. This allows multiple tasks (Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Task 4) to run concurrently without blocking each other. When a task is completed, it returns and stops so the event-loop can move on to the next task.",
    "slide number :13--AsyncIO works by using an event loop to handle non-blocking input/output operations. This means that while one operation is being processed, other tasks can also be running simultaneously. The event loop also fetches and processes pending tasks in a predetermined order.",
    "slide number :14--AsyncIO works by having an event-loop that monitors input/output (IO) operations and waits for them to finish. Once an IO operation is done, any tasks that were waiting for it become available again. The event-loop then fetches these tasks and allows them to resume from where they left off in their coroutine. This process continues with multiple tasks until they are all completed.",
    "slide number :15--The text shows a Python code that uses the asyncio library to run two functions concurrently that simulate sleeping for 2 seconds each. The program uses asynchronous programming to delegate input/output tasks to the operating system and gives control back to the event loop. The main function uses asyncio.gather to run both sleep functions at the same time. When the program is executed, it will print messages indicating that it is sleeping for 2 seconds and then waking up after 2 seconds.",
    "slide number :16--The slide is reminding us not to spend too much time trying to make our code perfect before it's necessary. It is saying that focusing too much on optimization early on in the development process can lead to problems. This is a common belief in the software development community.",
    "slide number :17--This slide provides additional resources for understanding Python's AsyncIO module, which is used for asynchronous programming. The resources include a comprehensive guide on Python AsyncIO, a guide on Python concurrency, and an explanation of the asyncio mechanism in detail. These resources can help in learning how to work with asynchronous programming in Python."
